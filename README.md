# PROG1015 - Final Project
## **Task**: develop a console application that can store/edit tasks during run time.

This java application is called 'taskmaster' and can be used to temporarily create/store/edit tasks.
                                                                          
The application has five main functions:
+ Create tasks
+ Mark tasks as complete
+ Edit tasks
+ Delete tasks
+ Print all stored tasks

***

The current version of the application uses basic classes with a setter/getter approach to allow elements of the task list to be edited after their creation. 

***

To do: 
	* Modify how output is handled so that when output is needed a function is called instead of repeated code sections. - [ ]
	* Integrate file storage and persistent tasks. - [ ]
	* Web frontend. - [ ]
	* Creation of users and user-specific lists. - [ ]
