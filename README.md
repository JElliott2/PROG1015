# PROG1015 - Final Project
## **Task**: develop a console application that can store/edit tasks during run time.

This java application is called 'taskmaster' and can be used to temporarily create/store/edit tasks.

   __             __                        __           
  / /_____ ______/ /______ ___  ____ ______/ /____  _____

/ /_/ /_/ (__  ) ,< / / / / / / /_/ (__  ) /_/  __/ /    
\__/\__,_/____/_/|_/_/ /_/ /_/\__,_/____/\__/\___/_/     
                                                         
The application has five main functions:
	* Create tasks
	* Mark tasks as complete
	* Edit tasks
	* Delete tasks
	* Print all stored tasks

***

The current version of the application uses basic classes with a setter/getter approach to allow elements of the task list to be edited after their creation. 

***

To do: 
	* Modify how output is handled so that when output is needed a function is called instead of repeated code sections. - [ ]
	* Integrate file storage and persistent tasks. - [ ]
	* Web frontend. - [ ]
	* Creation of users and user-specific lists. - [ ]
